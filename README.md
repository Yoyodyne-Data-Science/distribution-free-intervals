# Distribution-free Tolerance Intervals

In this README and accompanying notebook I'll explain some functions I wrote for calculating distribution-free tolerance intervals. Almost all the equations in those functions are directly reproduced from the excellent book *'Statistical Intervals A Guide for Practitioners and Researchers'* by William Q. Meeker, Gerald J. Hahn, Luis A. Escobar (Wiley, 2017), predominantly Chapter 5 (*Distribution-Free Statistical Intervals*). Before going into detail on these equations and their applications, let's provide a clear example where distribution-free tolerance intervals are required.

## Example: Estimating the time taken to complete a task
